                  Traditional programming education is broken. Developers spend
                  months watching endless tutorials, reading documentation, and
                  following along with outdated examples, only to find
                  themselves unprepared for real-world development challenges.

                <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  The tutorial hell is real - learners get stuck in a cycle of
                  consuming content without actually building anything
                  meaningful. This passive learning approach fails to develop
                  the problem-solving skills and practical experience that
                  employers value.
